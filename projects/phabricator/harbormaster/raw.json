Most application objects can be edited directly using synchronous\nAPIs (like `maniphest.edit`, `differential.revision.edit`, and so on).\n\nHowever, builds require long-running background processing and Habormaster\nobjects have a more complex lifecycle than most other application objects and\nmay spend significant periods of time locked by daemon processes during build\nexecition. A synchronous edit might need to wait an arbitrarily long amount of\ntime for this lock to become available so the edit could be applied.\n\nAdditionally, some edits may also require an arbitrarily long amount of time to\n//complete//. For example, aborting a build may execute cleanup steps which\ntake minutes (or even hours) to complete.\n\nSince a synchronous API could not guarantee it could return results to the\ncaller in a reasonable amount of time, the edit API for Harbormaster build\nobjects is asynchronous: to update a Harbormaster build or build target, use\nthis API (`harbormaster.sendmessage`) to send it a message describing an edit\nyou would like to effect or additional information you want to provide.\nThe message will be processed by the daemons once the build or target reaches\na suitable state to receive messages.\n\nSelect an object to send a message to using the `receiver` parameter.

See below for details.\n\nIf you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn't completed yet,\nyou can use the `work` message. This message doesn't have any direct effects,\nbut allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build\ntarget. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI\nwill update to show the progress which has been made.\n\nWhen sending a message to a build target to report the status or results of\na build, your message must include a `type` which describes the overall state\nof the build.
