This will record the build result, and continue the next step in the build if the build was waiting for a result.\n\nWhen you send a status message about a build target, you can optionally include detailed `lint` or `unit` results alongside the message. See below for details.\n\nIf you want to report intermediate results but a build hasn't completed yet, you can use the `work` message. This message doesn't have any direct effects, but allows you to send additional data to update the progress of the build target. The target will continue waiting for a completion message, but the UI will update to show the progress which has been made.\n\nMessage Types\n=============\nWhen you send Harbormaster a message, you must include a `type`, which describes the overall state of the build. For example, use `pass` to tell Harbormaster that a build completed successfully.\n\nSupported message types are:\n\n$1\n\nUnit Results\n============\nYou can report test results alongside a message. The simplest way to do this is to report all the results alongside a `pass` or `fail` message, but you can also send a `work` message to report intermediate results.\n\nTo provide unit test results, pass a list of results in the `unit` parameter. Each result should be a dictionary with these keys:\n\n$2\n\nThe `result` parameter recognizes these test results:\n\n$3\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `unit` parameter. It reports one passing test and one failing test:\n\n\n\n```lang=json\n$4```\n\nLint Results\n============\nLike unit test results, you can report lint results alongside a message. The `lint` parameter should contain results as a list of dictionaries with these keys:\n\n$5\n\nThe `severity` parameter recognizes these severity levels:\n\n$6\n\nThis is a simple, valid value for the `lint` parameter. It reports one error and one warning:\n\n```lang=json\n$7```\n\n",

Once builds pass, the revisions promote and are sent for review, which notifies reviewers.\n\nThe general intent of this workflow is to make sure reviewers are only spending time on review once changes survive automated tests. If a change does not pass tests, it usually is not really ready for review.\n\nIf you want to promote revisions out of \"Draft\" before builds pass, or promote revisions even when builds fail, you can change the promotion behavior. This may be useful if you have very long-running builds, or some builds which are not very important.\n\nUsers may always use \"Request Review\" to promote a \"Draft\" revision, even if builds have failed or are still in progress.",
