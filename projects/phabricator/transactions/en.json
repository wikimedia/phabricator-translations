This list of transactions on each object is the\nbasis for essentially all edits and comments. Reviewing the transaction\nrecord allows you to see who edited an object, when, and how their edit changed\nthings.\n\nOne common reason to call this method is that you're implementing a webhook and\njust received a notification that an object has changed. See the Webhooks\ndocumentation for more detailed discussion of this use case.\n\nOne Object Type at a Time\n=========================\n\nThis API method can query transactions for any type of object which supports\ntransactions, but only one type of object can be queried per call. For example:\nyou can retrieve transactions affecting Tasks, or you can retrieve transactions\naffecting Revisions, but a single call can not retrieve both.\n\nThis is a technical limitation arising because (among other reasons) there is\nno global ordering on transactions.\n\nTo find transactions for a specific object (like a particular task), pass the\nobject PHID or an appropriate object identifier (like `T123`) as an\n`objectIdentifier`.\n\nTo find all transactions for an object type, pass the object type constant as\nan `objectType`. For example, the correct identifier for tasks is `TASK`. (You\ncan quickly find an unknown type constant by looking at the PHID of an object\nof that type.)\n\nConstraints\n===========\n\nThese constraints are supported:\n\n  - `phids` //Optional list<phid>.// Find specific transactions by PHID. This\n    is most likely to be useful if you're responding to a webhook notification\n    and want to inspect only the related events.\n  - `authorPHIDs` //Optional list<phid>.// Find transactions with particular\n    authors.\n\nTransaction Format\n==================\n\nEach transaction has custom data describing what the transaction did. The\nformat varies from transaction to transaction. The easiest way to figure out\nexactly what a particular transaction looks like is to make the associated kind\nof edit to a test object, then query that object.\n\nNot all transactions have data: by default, transactions have a `null` \"type\"\nand no additional data. This API does not expose raw transaction data because\nsome of it is internal, oddly named, misspelled, confusing, not useful, or\ncould create security or policy problems to expose directly.\n\nNew transactions are exposed (with correctly spelled, comprehensible types and\nuseful, reasonable fields) as we become aware of use cases for them.\n",
