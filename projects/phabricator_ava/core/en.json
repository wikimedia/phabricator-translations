When Antivandalism is responding to user activity, each transaction is assigned a base score and the scores are then added together and multiplied by a factor based on the frequency of activity the user has generated. Faster editing produces a larger multiplier. The final score is compared to the value in **antivandalism.max-score**.  If the score is too high, thenthe account is either logged out of all sessions or disabled. To customize scores, provide a json-formatted map of transaction type keys with floating-point values. For most purposes, values should be between 0.0 and 1.0 for all transaction types.",
