Utilities for importing and exporting translation strings between phutil
libraries (including Phabricator) and Translatewiki.

Setup
=====

Clone the phabricator deployment repository {rPHDEP} and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Then:

```
cd translations
```


Exporting Strings
=================

This repository already has exported data, so you can just use the files
located in `projects/` if you don't need to regenerate up-to-date strings.

To export up-to-date strings from Phabricator, run:

```
./export.sh
```

This will update `projects/phabricator/en.json` and related files.


Generating Translations
=======================

If you have a translated string file and want to convert it into a form that
Phabricator can read, do this:

```
./generate.php
```

Then run arcanist to update `__phutil_library_map__.php`:

```
../arcanist/bin/arc liberate
```

Finally, commit the changes and push.

Adding a new language/locale to Phabricator
===========================================

To add a new language, copy one of the existing classes in `src/locales/` to a new file name.
Then edit the new file, changing the class name as well as the values returned by
`getLocaleCode` and `getLocaleName` to match the locale of the new language.

run `./lint.sh` to verify that you haven't introduced any PHP errors.

Finally run `../arcanist/bin/arc liberate` to update `__phutil_library_map__.php`
