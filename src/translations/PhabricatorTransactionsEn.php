    things.
    One common reason to call this method is that you\'re implmenting a webhook and
    just received a notification that an object has changed. See the Webhooks
    documentation for more detailed discussion of this use case.
    One Object Type at a Time
    =========================
    This API method can query transactions for any type of object which supports
    transactions, but only one type of object can be queried per call. For example:
    you can retrieve transactions affecting Tasks, or you can retrieve transactions
    affecting Revisions, but a single call can not retrieve both.
    This is a technical limitation arising because (among other reasons) there is
    no global ordering on transactions.
    To find transactions for a specific object (like a particular task), pass the
    object PHID or an appropriate object identifier (like `T123`) as an
    `objectIdentifier`.
    To find all transactions for an object type, pass the object type constant as
    an `objectType`. For example, the correct identifier for tasks is `TASK`. (You
    can quickly find an unknown type constant by looking at the PHID of an object
    of that type.)
    Constraints
    ===========
    These constraints are supported:
      - `phids` //Optional list<phid>.// Find specific transactions by PHID. This
        is most likely to be useful if you\'re responding to a webhook notification
        and want to inspect only the related events.
      - `authorPHIDs` //Optional list<phid>.// Find transactions with particular
        authors.
    Transaction Format
    ==================
    Each transaction has custom data describing what the transaction did. The
    format varies from transaction to transaction. The easiest way to figure out
    exactly what a particular transaction looks like is to make the associated kind
    of edit to a test object, then query that object.
    Not all transactions have data: by default, transactions have a `null` "type"
    and no additional data. This API does not expose raw transaction data because
    some of it is internal, oddly named, misspelled, confusing, not useful, or
    could create security or policy problems to expose directly.
    New transactions are exposed (with correctly spelled, comprehensible types and
    useful, reasonable fields) as we become aware of use cases for them.
